// Fetching one temperature of a nuclide's cross sections out of Arrow files
// that hold every temperature.
//
// The published `reactions.arrow` is written one Arrow record batch per
// (MT, temperature) and `energy.arrow` one batch per temperature, so every
// cross section and every union energy grid is already a contiguous byte range
// in its object. Each nuclide's `version.json` names those ranges
// (`reaction_ranges` keyed by MT then temperature label, `energy_ranges` keyed
// by temperature label, both as `[offset, length]`). This page draws one
// reaction at one temperature, so it asks for the schema plus the batches it
// needs as HTTP range requests and splices them into an Arrow IPC stream the
// wasm reader accepts. Fe56 at 294 K is about 340 kB for the total cross
// section against a 39 MB file.
//
// Nothing here touches the DOM or the network, so the arithmetic can be run
// under Node against the fixture files as well as in the worker, which is what
// `tests/ranges.test.mjs` does.
//
// This file is a verbatim copy of the one in nuclide_cross_section_plotter, and
// yani-online carries a third, larger variant of the same idea. Copies rather
// than a shared package on purpose: these are three static sites with no build
// step, and a dependency between them would buy less than it costs. The price
// of that choice is that each copy has to be tested where it lives, which is
// why these tests exist here rather than being assumed from the plotter's.
